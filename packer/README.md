This is an experimental [go](https://go.dev/) version of the compressor executable.

Building
--------

* Download and run the Go installer from [the Go website](https://go.dev/), or use your package manager to install it. Currently Go v1.19 or later is required.
* In the terminal/command line:

  `cd packer`

  `go get # ensure any dependent modules are downloaded`

  `go build`
* This should produce a `miny` executable.
